Step 1: Open visa session for COM9
  Substep 1: Set baud rate to 9600
  Substep 2: Set data bits to 8
  Substep 3: Set stop bits to 1.0
  Substep 4: Set parity to None
  Substep 4: Set flow control to none

Step 2: Start the instrument in local mode (for some unspecified safety reason)
  Substep 1: Construct the address (if the address is 1, then we send 00000001)
  Substep 2: Construct the txstring and allocate the rxstring (both 48 bits)
    Subsubstep 1: Set "disable AL" to 0 so we can tell when the measurement is done
  
  Substep 3: Loop over the bits in the address
    Subsubstep 1: Set the clock pulse (CP=RTS state) to 0
    Subsubstep 2: Read DI (CTS=data from instrument)
    Subsubstep 3: Set the data from computer (DC=DTC state) to the address bit in the current iteration
    Subsubstep 4: Wait for about 1 millisecond (or the shortest we can)
    Subsubstep 5: Set the clock pulse (CP=RTS state) to 1
    Subsubstep 6: Wait for about 1 millisecond (or the shortest we can)
    Subsubstep 7: Set the clock pulse (CP=RTS state) to 0
    Subsubstep 8: Set the data from computer to 0

  Substep 4: Strobe the picobus address
    Loop 3 times:
      Subsubstep 1: Set the clock pulse (CP=RTS state) to 0
      Subsubstep 2: Set the data from computer (DC=DTS state) to 0
      Subsubstep 3: Delay 1 ms
      Subsubstep 4: Set the DC state to 1
      Subsubstep 5: Delay 1 ms
      Subsubstep 6: Set the DC state to 0

  Substep 5: Loop over the bits in the txstring (not including address)
    Subsubstep 1: Set the clock pulse (CP=RTS state) to 0
    Subsubstep 2: Read DI (CTS=data from instrument) and write it to the rxstring
    Subsubstep 3: Set the data from computer (DC=DTC state) to the bit in the current iteration
    Subsubstep 4: Wait for about 1 millisecond (or the shortest we can)
    Subsubstep 5: Set the clock pulse (CP=RTS state) to 1
    Subsubstep 6: Wait for about 1 millisecond (or the shortest we can)
    Subsubstep 7: Set the clock pulse (CP=RTS state) to 0
    Subsubstep 8: Set the data from computer to 0

  Substep 6: Strobe the picobus txstring
    Loop 3 times:
      Subsubstep 1: Set the clock pulse (CP=RTS state) to 0
      Subsubstep 2: Set the data from computer (DC=DTS state) to 0
      Subsubstep 3: Delay 1 ms
      Subsubstep 4: Set the DC state to 1
      Subsubstep 5: Delay 1 ms
      Subsubstep 6: Set the DC state to 0

Step 3: Decode the received string

Step 4: Store the instrument settings in a local variable

Step 5: Enter loop over measurements
  Loop: 
    Step 1: Modify the local settings
    Step 2: Send the new settings
    Step 3: Wait for the signal to stabilize (Can take up to 15 seconds for low excitation changes)
    Step 4: Read from the ADC

Step 5: Set the bridge to local mode
Step 6: Close the visa session
